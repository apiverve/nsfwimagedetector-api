## Usage

### File Upload

This API requires a file upload. Use `executeWithFile()` to upload files:

```javascript
// Upload a file (path, Buffer, or ReadStream)
api.executeWithFile('/path/to/file.image', options, callback);
```

**Accepted file types:** .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
**Maximum file size:** 10 MB

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
// This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/image.jpg';

api.executeWithFile(filePath, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
// This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/image.jpg';

api.executeWithFile(filePath)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    // This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/image.jpg';

    try {
        const data = await api.executeWithFile(filePath);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

## Example Response

  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "isNSFW": false,
    "isSafe": true,
    "confidence": 0.987,
    "category": "neutral"
  }
}
```
